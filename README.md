<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Temperature Converter</b> is a C-based console application designed to facilitate quick and easy temperature conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This program allows users to choose the type of conversion they want to perform and provides accurate results, ensuring that temperature data is converted correctly for any use case.
<br />

<h2>Features:</h2>

- <b>User-Friendly Interface</b>: Simple, text-based interface prompts users to choose their desired conversion and input temperatures with ease.
- <b>Two-Way Conversion</b>: Offers both Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius conversions.
- <b>Precision Output</b>: Displays results with two decimal points for accuracy.
- <b>Looping Functionality</b>: Allows users to perform multiple conversions in one session without needing to restart the program.

<h2>How It Works:</h2>

1. <b>Conversion Selection</b>: The program starts by asking the user to choose the type of conversion—either from Celsius to Fahrenheit or from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
2. <b>Input Temperature</b>: Users are prompted to input the temperature value they wish to convert.
3. <b>Mathematical Conversion</b>: The program applies the correct mathematical formula to convert the temperature. It ensures floating-point accuracy to avoid errors due to integer division.
   - Celsius to Fahrenheit: <code>F = C × (9.0 / 5.0) + 32</code>
   - Fahrenheit to Celsius: <code>C = (F - 32) × (5.0 / 9.0)</code>
4. <b>Result Display</b>: The converted temperature is displayed with two decimal precision, ensuring clarity and precision in the results.
5. <b>Continue or Exit</b>: After displaying the result, the program asks if the user wants to perform another conversion. If the user chooses to continue, the program loops back to the conversion selection. Otherwise, it exits.

This tool is perfect for anyone needing quick and accurate temperature conversions, whether for academic purposes, cooking, or general interest. Its simplicity and precision make it a handy utility in various scenarios.
